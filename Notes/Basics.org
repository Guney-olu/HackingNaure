* What we did ?

  Translating between DNA and protein sequences using predefined genetic codes.

* Protein Sequence

  The protein sequence "MESLVPGFNEKTHVQLSLPVLQVRDVLVRGFGDSVEEVLSEARQ" is represented by three-letter combinations, where each triplet corresponds to an amino acid.

* DNA Sequence and Amino Acid Translations

  The sequence "attaaaggtt" is a fragment of a DNA sequence with associated amino acid translations. Each three-letter DNA sequence, known as a codon, codes for a specific amino acid in the protein:

  - 'ATA' codes for Isoleucine ('I')
  - 'ATC' codes for Isoleucine ('I')
  - 'ATT' codes for Isoleucine ('I')
  - 'ATG' codes for Methionine ('M')

  Note: This representation doesn't capture the full complexity of the genetic code found in living organisms.

* Cool Terms

  - **Gene**: A segment of DNA that contains instructions for making a specific protein or functional RNA molecule. Genes are composed of sequences of nucleotide bases (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine).
  
  - **Base Pair**: Refers to the complementary pairing of nucleotides in the DNA double helix. Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G). This complementary base pairing ensures the accurate transmission of genetic information during processes like DNA replication and transcription.
