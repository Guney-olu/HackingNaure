What we did ?
Translating between DNA and protein sequences using predefined genetic codes.

"MESLVPGFNEKTHVQLSLPVLQVRDVLVRGFGDSVEEVLSEARQ" is a protein sequence. Each three-letter combination in this sequence represents an amino acid

"attaaaggtt" sequence is a fragment of a DNA sequence and its associated amino acid translations. For example, 'ATA' in the DNA sequence corresponds to the amino acid 'I' (Isoleucine).
Each three-letter DNA sequence is called a codon, and it codes for a specific amino acid in the protein

'ATA' codes for Isoleucine ('I')
'ATC' codes for Isoleucine ('I')
'ATT' codes for Isoleucine ('I')
'ATG' codes for Methionine ('M')

# It do represent the full complexity of the genetic code found in living organisms

Cool Terms

A gene is a segment of DNA that contains the instructions for making a specific protein or functional RNA molecule. 
Genes are composed of sequences of nucleotide bases, also known as base pairs. 
The four nucleotide bases found in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). 
The sequence of these bases encodes the genetic information necessary for the synthesis of proteins and the regulation of various cellular processes

The term "base pair" refers to the complementary pairing of nucleotides in the DNA double helix. 
Adenine (A) pairs with thymine (T), and cytosine (C) pairs with guanine (G).
This complementary base pairing ensures the accurate transmission of genetic information during processes like DNA replication and transcription\
